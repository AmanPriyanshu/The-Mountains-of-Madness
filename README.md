# The Mountains of Madness

Interactive demos exploring procedural terrain generation algorithms through pure JavaScript implementations. From basic Perlin noise to advanced multifractal techniques, this project provides hands-on learning for game developers and computer graphics enthusiasts.

## Overview

This project demonstrates six different approaches to procedural terrain generation, each building on the limitations of previous methods. All implementations are pure JavaScript with real-time parameter controls and performance analysis.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. [Basic Perlin Noise](simple-perlin.html)
The foundation of procedural terrain - smooth, continuous noise that transforms random values into rolling hills through gradient-based interpolation.

### 2. [Additive Perlin Noise](additive-perlin.html) 
Fractal terrain generation through layered octaves. Multiple noise functions at different scales combine to create natural-looking landscapes with both large formations and fine details.

### 3. [Multiplicative Perlin Noise](multiplicative-perlin.html)
Terrain masking through layer multiplication instead of addition. Creates dramatic erosion patterns and sharp terrain contrasts by using each layer as a selective filter.

### 4. [Domain Warping](domain-warping.html)
Coordinate space distortion applied before noise sampling. Warps the sampling coordinates themselves to create organic, flowing terrain patterns that break free from grid-like artifacts.

### 5. [Exponential Slope Weighting](exponential-weighting.html)
Post-processing technique that selectively smooths steep terrain areas while preserving gentle slopes. Useful for creating playable game terrain by eliminating knife-edge ridges.

### 6. [Ridged Multifractal](ridged-multifractal.html)
Mathematical transformation that inverts valleys into sharp ridges. Each octave's influence depends on previous results, creating dramatic alpine terrain with realistic detail distribution.

## Features

- **Interactive Parameter Controls**: Real-time adjustment of all algorithm parameters
- **Performance Monitoring**: Chunk-based generation timing and analysis
- **Chunked Generation**: Terrain generated in tiles for scalability and streaming
- **3D Visualization**: Isometric rendering with wireframe overlay
- **Mathematical Formulas**: Complete equations for each technique
- **Educational Content**: Detailed explanations of each algorithm's behavior

## Technical Details

- Pure JavaScript implementation (no external libraries)
- Seeded random generation for reproducible results
- Optimized for real-time parameter manipulation
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Modular architecture for easy algorithm comparison

## Performance Considerations

Each algorithm has different computational costs:
- **Basic Perlin**: 1x baseline cost
- **Additive**: Linear scaling with octave count (3-6x typical)
- **Multiplicative**: Similar to additive but dramatic visual impact per layer
- **Domain Warping**: 6-10x cost due to coordinate transformation requirements
- **Exponential Weighting**: Post-processing pass, minimal additional cost
- **Ridged Multifractal**: Variable cost based on spectral weighting complexity

## Applications

These techniques are applicable to:
- Game world generation
- Procedural content creation
- Computer graphics research
- Generative art projects
- Educational demonstrations of noise functions
